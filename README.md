# Tech Blog- MVC

## Description

This Tech Blog Website serves as an interactive application, where developers can publish blog posts, read and comment on other developers' posts. The application follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm in its architectural structure. Authentication is required to log in so that the user can post an article and comment on other posts as well. 

While developing this website, I learned about using MVC to build an application. I gained experience with authorization and the use of cookies to create a user session. I strengthened my knowledge using the dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. I improved my skills working with APIs using CRUD operations and for managing data. 


## Usage

Once viewing the website, you are taken to the Home page. You can read posted blogs from others and see posted comments. If you log in, you gain additional access to the site so that you can post your own blog and comment on others' blogs. If you wish to delete your comment or blog post, you can do so as well.
